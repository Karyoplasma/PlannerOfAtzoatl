# PlannerOfAtzoatl
Helps to min-max your Temple of Atzoatl tiers.


Should be very straight-forward to use. Just put in your desired tier of the resulting temple and run the map tier incursions the program tells you to. The auto-bump checkbox toggles automatically setting the desired temple tier to the highest ran map. Needs Java.
